                  Adding on to more of Waluigi's movement code was very difficult because making sure he sensed the item and power-up or power-down would activate was very difficult. For example when Waluigi touches the bomb, he will randomly be dragged somewhere. However this took a bunch of time to get correct because I had to make sure that the bomb sprite was recieving the players touch so it could hide. Once I was able to do this, doing this for the other sprites would be easy. One other challenge from this code was calculating the speed for the speed boost and also making it exactly the same as the original movement but making it faster.

	          My inspiration for these sprites came from the plethora of mario games that I played when I was young and the power-ups or downs they gave came from those mario games as well. Creating the code for the Bomb Trap was my favorite because the bomb had to bounce back and forth like a trap(as it was intended to be) and if it ever touched the character it would drag im somewhere. I also had to make sure that the bomb would continue bouncing back and forth forever so I added the "forever" structure so it does it the whole game until touched which it will then hide. The speed of the bomb is not too fast but fast enough that if you do not move out of the way you will get caught in it's path.
